            <div style="display: inline-flex;">
            <p class="para1">
                Are you worried about your son/daughter returning late
                from office or going out for late-night parties? Concerned
                about not being able to take midnight strolls all by
                yourself? Worry not, Amigo has got something for you.
                <br>
                Amigo is a safety alert app developed by students from 
                the Indian Institute of Technology. Amigo acts as the
                one-stop platform at the time of emergency. You need 
                to press the HELP button three long times following which:
                <br>
                1. App users within 5 km distance and the user's contacts 
                will receive an alert notification, which will notify them
                about the impending danger.
                <br> 
                2. A group of the app users within 5 km and the user's 
                favorite contacts is formed where they could discuss the
                possible ways of reaching and helping the user.
                <br>
                3. The user's live location details and personal 
                details(name, age, profile pic, for the ease of 
                identification) are displayed in all the 
                groups of the user and the group of the nearby users 
                formed.
                <br>
                4. The user can send voice and video messages in a 
                hassle-free manner, which will be sent to all the groups.
                <br>
                5. The user can search for nearby police station 
                locations and their contact numbers as well as routes 
                to safer places in one click.
                <br>
                Always test run the app with your family members to 
                understand it's working. Add your dear ones
                (family members, friends, relatives) to the app, send 
                them friend requests, add them to your contacts, form 
                their groups, choose favorite contacts and test run 
                the app.

                She grew up learning how to become a perfect woman. An ideal woman WHO MUST NOT BE MOLESTED, MUST NOT BE RAPED.
                <br>
                Domestic violence and rape have been prevalent since the dawn of the history of humankind.
                <br>
                On average, 24 people per minute are the victims of rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner.

                On average, 24 people per minute are the victims of rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner.
                <br>
                Alarming right?
                <br>
                Well, the animosity for rape wasn't that functional until 2012, the Nirbhaya gang-rape case that shook the nation to its core.
                <br>
                People became aware, but yet the numbers continued to increase steadily.
                Being humane is using our conscience. Let's hope to fight this through so that we are brave enough to step outside without the fear of falling prey to our very own kind.
                Amigo is there for you, by you, with you for all these five problems and more to come.
